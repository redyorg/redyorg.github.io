### **Our Work**

### &nbsp;

Our aim is to promote better health care knowledge and symptom recognition, improved preventive measures, and to instigate care-seeking behaviour. Limited access to healthcare and lack of health-seeking attitude contribute to the high number of undiagnosed cases. People need to understand the symptoms and causes of disease, so that they may recognise the need to consult a professional.
