#### **Overview**

* Sub-Saharan Africa [ranks the highest in the world on the Gender Inequality Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII).

* Gender inequality stunts human development and economic growth, [costing Sub-Saharan Africa an average of $US95 billion a year](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr/2016-africa-human-development-report.html).

* Women represent [61% of the workforce](http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/brief/improving-gender-equality-in-africa), the largest ratio in the world and yet still make significantly less than men.

* Over [80% of women in Mali, Guinea and Sierra Leone have undergone FGM](https://www.unicef.org/wcaro/overview_4571.html).

* Approximately [50%, or more, of women in Sudan, Mauritania, Djibouti, Chad, Gambia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Mali believe FGM to be an acceptable practice](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/female-genital-mutilation-and-cutting/#).

* [76% of girls and women 15–49 years old have undergone FGM, but only 9% favour continuation of the practice](https://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/documents/english/SOWC2014_In%20Numbers_28%20Jan.pdf).

* Since Kenya outlawed FGM in 2011, less than 23% of cases taken to court have resulted in convictions.

#### **Our Work**

Right For Education’s aim is to challenge the social attitude towards women and their role in sub-Saharan Africa. Most African countries have gender neutral laws. In practice, tradition and cultural norms, however have resulted in the limited implementation of human rights.

Reaching over 3 million people, we published material aimed at male, female and mixed audiences. Despite the gender disparities in mobile phone ownership and internet usage, 33% of Right For Education’s followers are female. Right For Education has created a safe community where people are free to express themselves. This has given invaluable insight into the social causes of gender inequality in Sub-Saharan Africa.

#### **Some of the comments we have received from our audience include:**

“This painful act must be abolished in the name of tradition.”

“Some African countries are still deep in culture and are not willing to let go of their culture and its ways. That disadvantages women from showing their many capabilities like being a leader, being creative being a part of something big. Women are disadvantaged by men in so many ways because of the culture and it forces women to look down on themselves and they end up being too afraid to voice out their thoughts, to lead, they end up being forced into so many things I've lost count.”

“Dans une relation quelconque (amour fraternel, amical, ou amoureux) il doit d'abord exister le respect mutuel, la compr&eacute;hension de l'un &agrave; l'autre, la patience, la ma&icirc;trise de soi, la soutenance mutuelle mais surtout le partage et les &eacute;changes d'id&eacute;es sous le contr&ocirc;le de Dieu qui donne en abondance tes ces qualit&eacute;s ou dons d'autant plus que c'est pas donn&eacute; &agrave; n'importe qui d'en poss&egrave;de ou disposer.”
