### **Our Work**

## &nbsp;

Whilst human rights are recognised in the constitutions of most Sub-Saharan countries, traditions and customs severely limit their implementation. Social attitude and cultural norms are one of the major contributors towards the dearth of basic rights throughout the region. R:Ed’s aim is to promote African values that have a positive effect on society; challenging traditions that directly contribute to the stunted development of Human Rights.

Social attitude is one of the driving forces resulting in the lack of implementation of human rights. Targeting both those who contribute to the social injustices, and those who fall victim to it, these 10 learning materials have reached over 4 million people. Using a variety of approaches, we are able to promote awareness on how human rights inevitably lead to greater human development and economic growth.
