As an official partner of Facebook internet.org’s [Free Basics platform,](https://info.internet.org/en/story/free-basics-from-internet-org/) our materials are available without data charge to an ever-increasing population. Our online platform allows people from all over the continent direct access to invaluable information.

We give an objective and positive view which facilitates the discussion of sensitive topics. Our readers discuss and develop their own views, which vary depending on the context and their cultural background. Our content takes our audience’s circumstances into account. With concise language, we make complicated reading material accessible to all.

REdy provides people access to information to motivate them to learn. We publish articles that highlight the benefits of learning, all in an African context. We believe the most efficient teaching tool is inspiring others to learn.
