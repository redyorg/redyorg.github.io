As an official partner of Facebook internet.org’s [Free Basics platform,](https://info.internet.org/en/story/free-basics-from-internet-org/) our materials are available without data charge to an ever-increasing population that is being connected to the internet. Our online platform allows people from all over the continent, and particularly in remote locations, direct access to invaluable information. We connect with our audience directly, so there is no risk of losing the message through intermediaries.

We try to give an objective and positive view which facilitates the discussion of sensitive topics. Our readers are encouraged to discuss and develop their own views, which varies depending on the context and their cultural background. Our content takes our audience’s circumstances into account and has the potential of saving lives. With the appropriate language, we make complicated reading material accessible to all.

R:Ed not only provides people access to information, we motivate them to learn. We publish articles that highlight the benefits of learning, all in an African context. We believe the most efficient teaching tool is inspiring others to learn.
