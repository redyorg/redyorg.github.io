Right For Education hosts a series of internship programmes with Oxford University throughout the year, attracting dedicated individuals who are looking to make an impact. A special congratulations to our latest interns from Oxford University who have just finished their placement with us: Alice Rubbra, Matthews McFahn and Jenna Elliott.

With subjects ranging from history & politics to mathematics and physics; each applied the the skills and knowledge gained during the programme to produce relevant, culturally appropriate content in their fields of expertise. Their tremendous enthusiasm, dedication and creativity lead them to create a combined total of 63 new learning materials. Their work has the potential to change lives and will be read by millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa.
