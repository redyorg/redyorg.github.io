<div class="section section-numbers"><div class="title-area"><h2>YES TO EDUCATION</h2><h5 class="subtitle text-gray">By James Okeme, a R:Ed reader</h5><div class="separator separator-danger"></div></div><pre class="text-center">    Imagine a generation
    that relegates Education to a hidden location.
    What will be the situation
    if not retardation instead of illumination?
    What will be the situation
    If not like a child suffering from malnutrition?
    Only if they have seen procrastination as an abomination.

    Who birthed Civilization?
    Answer me.
    Who nurtured millions of World population
    and raised Nations now speaking about industrialization?
    Who? Who? Who if not Education?

    Education is the foundation
    for proper formation.
    It widens your imagination
    sharps your dreams and sharpens your vision.
    Education sets you on a meaningful mission.
    It is the centre for information
    without which the mind is denied renovation.

    There's no limitation in Education
    'Cause determination is the fuel that drives this vehicle of transformation.
    Education doesn't start at entrance examination
    and doesn't stop after graduation.
    You know why?
    Education is beyond the four walls of an institution.
    It's more than the addition and the substraction
    More than the dictation and comprehension.
    Education is the continuous change in the mind's orientation.

    So, say YES TO EDUCATION
    Accept it without consideration.
    Then you'll live a life of satisfaction
    And be happy with your profession.
