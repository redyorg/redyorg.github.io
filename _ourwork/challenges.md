&nbsp;

Right For Education recognises that one of the major contributors of all the challenges we face is rooted in social attitude. We use all of our resources and expertise to dissect the issues in a social African context. We believe that it is important to be realistic and pragmatic, so we make sure that we tackle factors that will make a real difference.

> #### Â Access to educational materials - Infrastructure

Lack of access to educational materials remains one of the biggest barriers to social progress. Poor infrastructure and lack of access to electricity are only two of the reasons why traditional approaches have often proven unsuitable. Yet, mobile penetration in Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the fastest growing in the world. R:Ed therefore makes sure that all its digital products are low-data and mobile friendly and that our communication strategy focuses on the predominant social media channels used in the region.

> #### Access to educational materials - Cultural differences

Fantastic work is being carried out by organisations to build schools and make resources available in the region. However at R:Ed, we focus on the specific social attitudes that hinder the progress of access to education.

> #### Locally relevant content

A lack of locally relevant content has been named as a primary reason for lack of digital engagement in Sub-Saharan Africa. At R:Ed, we understand how important it is to create quality educational materials specifically for the audience they are targeted at. All our educational content is unique and we research, identify, and test the topics most relevant to our audience.

> #### Lack of digital skills

A lack of digital skills has been named as the biggest obstacle to internet adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa. Right for Education makes sure that we reach our community through channels that they feel comfortable using, guiding them clearly through the process of using our products.

> #### Education for sustainable social change

We want to make sure that our educational materials are relevant to our audience in the short and long-term. Social change takes time, but it is a process that starts today. That is why we cover a range of topics; from practical subjects like business and health, to subjects that will change cultural understanding over time such as the importance of equal access to education for men and women.

> #### A Pan-African approach

Africa is a continent of 54 diverse countries. Our aim is to inspire learning, entrepreneurship and African pride as key components of sustainable progress in the region.
