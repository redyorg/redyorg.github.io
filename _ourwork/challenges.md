&nbsp;

The major challenge we face is rooted in social attitude. We use all of our resources and expertise to dissect the issues in a social African context. We make sure that we tackle factors that will make a real difference.

> #### Â Access to educational materials - Infrastructure

Lack of access to educational materials remains one of the biggest barriers to social progress. Poor infrastructure and lack of access to electricity are only two of the reasons why traditional approaches have proven unsuitable. Yet, mobile penetration in Africa is one of the fastest growing in the world. We offer digital products that are low-data and mobile friendly; our communication strategy focuses on the predominant social media channels used in the region.

> #### Access to educational materials - Cultural differences

In contrast with the work carried out by governments and organisations in the region, which concentrate on childhood education, REdy focuses on life-long learning. We challenge social attitudes that hinder the progress of social development. Our aim is not to write answers, but to raise questions.

> #### Locally relevant content

A lack of locally relevant content has been named as a primary reason for lack of digital engagement in Africa. At REdy, we understand how important it is to create quality materials specifically for the audience they are targeted at. All our content is unique; we research, identify, and test the topics most relevant to our audience.

> #### Lack of digital skills

A lack of digital skills has been named as the biggest obstacle to internet adoption in Africa. REdy makes sure that we reach our community through channels that they feel comfortable using, guiding them clearly through the process of using our products.

> #### Education for sustainable social change

Our content is relevant to our audience in the short and long-term. Social change takes time, but it is a process that starts today. We cover a range of topics; from practical subjects like business and health, to subjects that will change cultural understanding over time such as the importance of equal access to education for men and women.

> #### A Pan-African approach

Africa needs to find a consistent voice on essential topics for modern life. Our aim is to inspire learning, entrepreneurship and African pride as key components of sustainable progress in the region.
