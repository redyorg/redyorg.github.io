Every REdy campaign tailored specifically to the demands of the situation. Underlying each one is a systemic approach that allows us to make the most of the work we do:

&nbsp;

> #### Stage 1: Identifying the problem

REdy has a diverse audience, consisting of different cultures, languages and values. The first step of a campaign is therefore to research and identify the social causes of the issue and who it affects. This allows us to determine the target audience for the campaign.

&nbsp;

> #### Stage 2: Gaging Social Attitude

Once REdy has identified the target audience, we then conduct our own research into social attitudes surrounding the issue. We publish a series of learning material, each designed to gage the social reaction of a specific point relating to the issue.

&nbsp;

> #### Stage 3: Differentiating between objective and method

Some African values and traditions hinder the development of human rights. It is therefore likely that the issue may challenge a person’s viewpoint or beliefs. The objective is to instigate social change surrounding the issue. The method, is to present your arguments in a way that runs parallel with core African values.

&nbsp;

> #### Stage 4: Campaign Design

The campaign design consists of finding the optimal method of instigating social change in the target audience(s). Using all of the information we have gathered, we create new and innovative avenues for accomplishing the campaign’s objective.

&nbsp;

> #### Stage 5: Implementation

The timeline of a campaign may differ depending on the nature of the project. It takes time to achieve social change, but it is our job to expedite the process. Exploiting all of the resources at our disposal, we strategically launch a digital movement that is guaranteed to reach million of people across Sub-Saharan Africa.
