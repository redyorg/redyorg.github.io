> "As the king of the Ewe in Togo and a member of the National Human Rights Commission, I work with many NGOs in Togo, particularly in the field of education, because I strongly believe in all the possibilities that education can enable a person to fulfil. These possibilities are endless and we should devote time and effort to educating children as well as adults, now for a better and stronger future."

> Togbui endorses R:Ed for its unique esteem for culture, traditions and African values: "I support the Right for Education project founded by Dr. Susann Dattenberg-Doyle, Nana Ngoryisi Dziwornu of Gbi Kpoeta (Ghana) for the promotion of education in Africa.”
