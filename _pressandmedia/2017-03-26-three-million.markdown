Right For Education is proud to announce that it now has 3+ million followers across over 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, marking a year of continuous growth from originally 80,000 followers this time last year.

Our diverse pan-African community continues to grow. Over the last 3 months, we have grown our community by more than 60%, reached 300% growth in engagement and with over 100,000 readers in each of our top ten countries, we have managed to break down cultural, linguistic and religious barriers. It is thanks to our followers and the countless men and women from around the world who dedicate their time and knowledge to the organisation, that we may continue to fan the flames of social change on important African issues.
