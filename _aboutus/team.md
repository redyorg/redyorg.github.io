Our team is as diverse as the audience we serve, consisting of members with different personalities, cultures and experiences. A strong commitment and a passion for social impact and effecting positive change is what has brought us together.

We combine all our skills and knowledge to come up with new and creative ways of communicating with our readers and instigating positive social change across the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa.

We believe that teamwork, a constant desire to improve, and humbleness to our cause are the key ingredients to achieving our goals. However, none of this would be possible without the countless experts from around the globe who donate their time and knowledge. Working together, with an ever expanding community of dedicated men and women, we provide the necessary tools that can help change the world!
