> ### *We believe in help through self-help. Education is the best way to end poverty.*

&nbsp;

Our mission is to provide all Africans an equal opportunity to live a healthy, financially secure and happy life.

Right for Education is a digital movement seeking to promote positive African values and be a catalyst for social change.

We want to create a pan-African community consisting of millions of members, all learning and debating important African issues in a safe and trusted environment.

We want to inspire the rest of the world that Africa is ready to become an equal partner in our global world.
