> "Upon completing construction of the school in my village in Africa, I realised that access to information was one of the key challenges facing the continent. Bringing books in from abroad proved to be inefficient and the content was not appropriate for our audience in Africa. R:Ed was founded in 2014 and is the embodiment of the idea that the whole continent should have access to learning material that was created specifically for them. But it is not just about access. We want to change the mindsets that restricted access to education in the first place."&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Right for Education is a unique Pan-African movement, dedicated to educating and empowering people in over 45 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use the democratising power of the internet to connect and build a community of Africans who, like us, believe that the future is Africa's!

### &nbsp;

### Our work is exclusively created for our audience in Sub-Saharan Africa

&nbsp;

All people have the right to integrate knowledge in the context of their own culture, so we make sure that all our learning materials are relevant and respectful of the diversity of African culture.

As the biggest, independent communicator in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Right for Education Foundation is solely concerned with issues regarding the African continent and its people. We believe that education can strengthen society and inspire positive social change.

&nbsp;

### We believe in active learning and encourage independence

&nbsp;

Our educational approach is unique, and we believe in two-way communication and an active approach to learning. We work to change beliefs and mindsets, ensuring that our work is based on cultural tolerance and listening to the messages we receive guarantees unconditional positive feedback.

### &nbsp;

### Our E-Library is the foundation of the work we do

&nbsp;

Since 2014, Right for Education Foundation has reached over 10 million Africans with digital learning content via our social media channels. Our E-Library consisting of hundreds of texts on topics such as business, health, and human rights, forms the basis of what R:Ed is about.

We work with expert authors from the worldâ€™s leading universities to provide online educational content that reaches millions of people, even in remote areas, across over 35 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Via our E-Library, we:

&nbsp;

* Publish content specifically written for our African audience. We give special regard to their values and culture and incorporate them in all of our work.

* Provide information in both English and French.

* Update our followers on new topics and new ideas.

* We have so far reached over 450 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa directly.
