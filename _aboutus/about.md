Right for Education is a unique Pan-African movement, dedicated to educating and empowering people in over 45 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use the democratising power of the internet to connect and build a community of Africans who, like us, believe that the future is Africa’s!

<h3 class="mt-5">How we started</h3>

> “Upon completing construction of the school in my village in Africa, I realised that access to information was one of the key challenges facing the continent. Bringing books in from abroad proved to be inefficient and the content was not appropriate for our audience in Africa. R:Ed was founded in 2014 and is the embodiment of the idea that the whole continent should have access to learning material that was created specifically for them. But it is not just about access. We want to change the mindsets that restricted access to education in the first place.” &nbsp;
