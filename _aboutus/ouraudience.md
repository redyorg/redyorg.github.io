Research conducted by the GSMA found that one of the greatest barriers to internet usage in Sub-Saharan Africa was from lack of awareness and locally relevant content. As of 2017, Facebook remains the the most effective way of communicating with Africa. 44% of the total internet users on the continent use Facebook regularly. As of March 2017, Right For Education’s followers represent 2.07% of the total Facebook users in the whole of Africa.
