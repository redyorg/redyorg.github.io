### Our work is exclusively created for our audience in Africa

&nbsp;

All people have the right to integrate knowledge in the context of their own culture, so we make sure that all our learning materials are relevant and respectful of the diversity of African culture.

As the biggest, independent communicator in Africa, the Right for Education Foundation is solely concerned with issues regarding the African continent and its people. We believe that education can strengthen society and inspire positive social change.


&nbsp;

### We believe in active learning and encourage independence

&nbsp;

Our educational approach is unique. We believe in two-way communication and an interactive approach to learning. We work to change beliefs and mindsets. Our work is based on cultural tolerance. We listen to the messages we receive, guaranteeing unconditional positive feedback.
